# procedural-notes

ðŸ“š Used a combination of **recursion and generative AI** to autonomously and procedurally create an entire mini-wikipedia notebook as a **`proof of concept`**.

## Concepts used: 
**Recursion:** To traverse nested list of semantic topcis

**Generative AI:** use of the OpenAI API to use a predefined engineered model, which is told to output .markdown files 

Technically this could be applied to anything: 
- Enter the overarching topic of the wikipedia page
- The number of subtopics you would like
- Specify directory
- Preferences
  - Emojis
 
## Example:
A complete, interlinked, tagged, completely 'original' mini-wiki of Data Science concepts
