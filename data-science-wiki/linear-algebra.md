## Introduction 📚

Linear algebra, traditionally a subfield of mathematics, is a fundamental subject for many areas of study including computer science, physics and machine learning.
Key concepts within linear algebra include vectors, matrices and their operations, as well as their applications in solving linear equations.

## Vectors 🏹
In linear algebra, a vector is a geometric object that has both magnitude and direction. 
- For example, a velocity vector describes both speed and direction of motion.
- In the computer science realm, vectors are often thought of as lists of numbers.

### Operations on Vectors
1. **Vector addition**
    - The sum of two vectors creates a new vector.
2. **Scalar multiplication**
   - Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes the magnitude (and possibly direction) of the vector.
3. **Dot product**
   - A way to multiply vectors returning a scalar.

---

## Matrices 📋
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. It can be thought as a table of numbers or a collection of vectors.

### Operations on Matrices:
1. **Matrix addition**
    - You can add two matrices by adding the corresponding entries together.
2. **Scalar multiplication**
   - You can multiply a matrix by a scalar by multiplying each entry of the matrix by the scalar.
3. **Matrix multiplication**
   - The product of two matrices is a new matrix.

## Dot and Cross Products ✖️
### Dot Product 📌
- Dot product of two vectors results in a scalar.
- It measures the length of one vector projected onto the other.

### Cross Product 📏
- Cross product of two vectors results in a vector.
- A new vector is perpendicular to the plane containing the original vectors.

---

## Linear Transformations 🔄
- Linear transformations, often represented by matrices, map vectors from one vector space to another while preserving any operations done in original vector space.

---

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors 🎛️
- An Eigenvector is any vector that doesn’t change direction during a given transformation.
- The Eigenvalue is the scalar that is used to transform (i.e., scale) an Eigenvector.
