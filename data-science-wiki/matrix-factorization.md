Matrix Factorization, also known as Matrix Decomposition, is a technique in linear algebra üìò that breakdowns a matrix into its constituent parts, making complex computations simpler and more efficient.

## Introduction

- Matrix Factorization can decompose a matrix into multiple matrices so that when these sub-matrices are multiplied, the original matrix is retrieved. 

- For instance, an m x n matrix can be factorized into:
    - m x r matrix AND r x n matrix.
    - Here, r is the rank of the original matrix and it often acts as a key factor in reducing dimensions.

- The formula for matrix factorization is given as:

- Here, A is original matrix, P and Q are factorized matrices and n is the rank.

## Methods

Several methods can be used for Matrix Factorization. Commonly used include:

1. `SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)`
    - This method decomposes a matrix into three other matrices. It works effectively even when data is missing or is sparse.

Example in Python:
```python
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.linalg import svd

    A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    print(A)
    U, s, VT = svd(A)
    print(U)
    print(s)
    print(VT)
```

2. `PCA (Principal Component Analysis)`
    - PCA can be implemented through SVD. It reduces a large set of variables to a small set that still contains most of the information in the large set (data reduction).

3. `NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)`
    - As the name suggests, this method is used when the matrix carries non-negative values. It is useful in the textual analysis.

## Applications

Matrix Factorization techniques are often used in:
- Information Retrieval: Such as latent semantic indexing where documents and terms are associated by factorizing document-term matrix.
- Recommender Systems: For example, Netflix movie recommendation based on the user-item interaction.
- Image and Dimensionality Reduction: PCA and SVD are used in image compression, and to reduce dimensions of large datasets in Machine Learning.

## Conclusion

Matrix Factorization is a multiple-step mathematical procedure used to reduce dimensions, identify important information, simplify calculations, and identify latent factors within data.

Remember, practice makes it perfect. Try different data sets and scenarios to master these algorithms.
