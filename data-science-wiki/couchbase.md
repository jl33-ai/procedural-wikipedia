## Installation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

```bash
wget https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-release/couchbase-release-1.0-6-amd64.deb 
sudo dpkg -i couchbase-release-1.0-6-amd64.deb

pip install couchbase
```

## Features üåü

- **N1QL (Non-First Normal Form Query Language)**: It allows you to query JSON data in a way that is very similar to SQL.

- **NICKEL (N1QL)**: It is a declarative query language that extends SQL for JSON.

- **SDKs**: Couchbase provides SDKs for the most popular programming languages, so you can integrate your applications with Couchbase easily.

- **Flexible JSON Model**: Couchbase uses a flexible, schema-less JSON model, which can adapt to your changing requirements.

## Examples üåà

After installing Couchbase and its Python SDK, you can start working on it using Python. Here is a simple CRUD example:

```python
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator

cluster = Cluster('couchbase://localhost', authenticator=PasswordAuthenticator('username', 'password'))
bucket = cluster.bucket('default')
collection = bucket.default_collection()

# Create
collection.upsert('my-document', {'name': 'john doe'})

# Retrieve
result = collection.get('my-document')
print(result.content_as[str])

# Update
collection.upsert('my-document', {'name': 'john doe', 'age': 30})

# Delete
collection.remove('my-document')
```

This example starts by connecting to a Couchbase cluster and authenticating. Then, it opens a bucket and gets a reference to the default collection.

Then, it performs CRUD operations on a document named ‚Äòmy-document‚Äô.

## Conclusion üèÅ

With Couchbase, you can create an engaging experience for your users due to its flexible data model and powerful N1QL language.

Remember, no matter how your applications needs change over time, Couchbase can adapt to those needs due to its flexible and schema-less JSON model.

Also, even if you come from a SQL background, you will find yourself at home with Couchbase‚Äôs SQL-based query language.
