Image segmentation is a process of dividing an image into multiple segments or sets of pixels. This can be helpful in image analysis as it allows us to understand and modify the image at a more granular level.

### Description :speech_balloon:

- Image segmentation turns a complex image into a set of simpler regions that can be individually analysed.
- It has numerous applications, including object recognition, image editing, image retrieval, machine learning, security and surveillance, etc.

### Types :label:

Image segmentation methods can broadly be divided into the following:

1. **Thresholding-based methods:** :arrows_counterclockwise:
   Based on the threshold value for pixels, image is segmented into corresponding segments.
   
2. **Edge-based methods:** :cornerspin_top_left:
   Here, the borders or edges of objects in an image are identified. This is commonly used in applications like object recognition.

3. **Region-based methods:** :large_blue_circle:
   In this type of image segmentation, similar pixels in terms of color, intensity or texture are grouped together.

### Libraries Used :books:

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

### Example :pencil:

Here is a simple example using OpenCV for image segmentation:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.png', 0)

# Apply Otsu's thresholding
ret2, thresh_img = cv2.threshold(img,0,255,cv2.THRESH_BINARY+cv2.THRESH_OTSU)

cv2.imshow('Segmented Image', thresh_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
__Note:__ Make sure to replace `'image.png'` with your actual image path.
