Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a subtype of unsupervised learning methods, where the models are trained to predict a part of the data given another part. In contrast to supervised learning, SSL eliminates the need for manually-annotated examples during training.

## :star: Overview 

- Self-Supervised Learning shifts the burden of supervision from relying on human-provided labels to extracting supervision from the input data itself.
- It's an attempt to use the structure inherent in the data to provide supervision for training.
- In other words, the objective of SSL is to learn a good representation of data through pretext tasks which is then used downstream for other tasks.

Example:

Imagine we have a dataset with only input features (X), but no corresponding target (Y). Traditional Supervised Learning would struggle here as there are no explicit labels to learn from. However, with SSL, we can generate our own labels from the input data itself. One simple way could be predicting the second half of a sentence given the first half.

## :wrench: Techniques

1. AutoEncoders :building_construction:

    - An AutoEncoder is a type of neural network designed to reconstruct its input.
    - The aim is to create a compressed representation of the input and then reconstruct it from the compressed form.

2. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) :dart:

    - GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator network and a discriminator network.
    - The goal of the generator is to generate data similar to the training data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data.

3. Predictive Methods :crystal_ball:

    - These methods generally involve predicting a part of the input data from other parts.
    - E.g., predicting the next word in a sentence, or predicting the color of a grayscale image.

## :balance_scale: Pros and Cons

**Pros**
- Reduces dependency on manually-labelled data for training.
- Can generate more useful, richer representations than unsupervised learning.

**Cons**
- It can be tricky to design a good pretext task.
- The learnt representations are specific to the pretext task and may not necessarily be useful for other tasks.

## :checkered_flag: Conclusion

SSL is an exciting and promising direction within the field of machine learning. By leveraging the inherent structure of data, it has the potential to outperform other methods that rely extensively on manually-labelled data.
