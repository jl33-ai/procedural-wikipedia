**Hill-Climb**, a key concept in Artificial Intelligence, is a heuristic search technique. It follows the metaphor of climbing up the surface of a hill and stops when it reaches the top-most point i.e., the peak — the point where all neighboring points are not better (have a lower value).

The instances where hill-climbing is beneficial involve problems where we have a complete dataset. It works perfectly for smaller datasets but struggles as the size and complexity of the problem increase.

## How Does Hill-Climbing Work? 🤷‍♂️

1. **Choose a random state as the initial state:** To start hill climbing, first, choose a random state, which will be where you first start your hill climb.

2. **Keep moving until we reach a better state:** If a neighboring state is a better state (i.e., offers a better solution), then move to that state.

3. **Stop when no better state can be found:** Once a state is reached where no better neighboring states can be found, the process is stopped and the solution is obtained.

## Types of Hill Climbing 🎯

1. **Simple Hill Climbing:** It evaluates the neighbor node state and compares it with the current state. If the neighbor is better, it moves, otherwise it halts.

2. **Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing:** It examines all neighboring nodes and selects the node closest to the solution for the next move.

3. **Stochastic Hill Climbing:** It randomly selects a neighbor node and decides (based on how much improvement the node provides) whether to move to it or examine another.

## Example 📖

Below is a simple example of how hill climbing works.

```
Suppose that you have a number line from 1-100. You have to reach to 100 starting from 1 where incrementing one number is a step.

Hill climbing will start from 1, take one step at a time till 100, and return the steps incrementally as it finds no other better state (higher number) after 100.
```

## Limitations 💡

1. **Local Maxima:** The algorithm could reach a peak which is not the best solution (global maxima), but no neighboring state is better so it stops.

2. **Plateau:** This is a flat state or series of states where no better neighboring state is found and could cause the algorithm to get struck.

3. **Ridge:** These are sequence of peaks, where getting the best solution is difficult as a small change might lead you to a much lower value.

## Conclusion 🏁

Despite its limitations, hill climbing is a popular and robust algorithm often used to solve optimization problems. The algorithm's simplicity enables easy conceptual understanding and use in a wide range of applications in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
  
For further study, consider investigating into problems and datasets where hill climbing is an efficient solution.
