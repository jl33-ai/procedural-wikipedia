### Set Goals <a name="set-goals"></a> ⏳
- Understand the project's scope and objectives.
- Set small, achievable goals to keep you focused and motivated.
- Utilize the `projects` function in GitHub, and create small tasks that lead to the ultimate goal.


### Prioritization <a name="prioritization"></a> 📚
- Use the GitHub `Labels` and `Milestones` features to prioritize your tasks effectively.
- Avoid being stuck on less important tasks, always work on high-priority tasks first.
  - Example: You can create a label named `Urgent` or `High-Priority` and attach it to those issues that need a quick response.

### Plan Your Tasks <a name="plan-your-tasks"></a> 📓
- Github's `Projects` and `Kanban Board` can act as your to-do list.
- Arrange your tasks according to their priority and deadlines.
- Adjust and rearrange your tasks whenever necessary.
   - Example: You can create a project with columns like `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Completed`.

### Setting Deadlines <a name="setting-deadlines"></a> 🕰️
- Deadlines can create a sense of urgency and help to finish tasks promptly.
- With the `Milestones` feature, you can group issues and pull requests to track a project more effectively.
- Never set unrealistic deadlines, It can create pressure and reduce the quality of your work.
   - Example: You can attach a `1.0 Release` milestone to all the tasks necessary for the first release.

### Avoid Distractions <a name="avoid-distractions"></a> 🚫
- Try to limit the noise around you.
- Turn off unnecessary notifications on your device.
- Keep your workspace clean to avoid unnecessary distractions.

### Say No to Multitasking <a name="say-no-to-multitasking"></a>🛑
- Work sequentially rather than working on multiple tasks at the same time.
- Refrain from switching between tasks to enhance productivity.
   - Example: Avoid checking emails or messages while writing code. Separate these tasks and work on them in their respective time slots.
