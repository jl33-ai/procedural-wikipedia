### GitHub Fundamentals 💻
* GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, enabling multiple people to work together on projects.
* Repositories (often known as repos) are where projects live. They can contain folders & files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything needed for the project. Every project should include a README file to provide information about the project.
* Example of creating a new repository: 
```markdown
> Click "+", "New repository", Name the repository, write short description, Choose to make the repository public or private, Initialize this repository with a README.
```

### Version Control 🔐
* GitHub allows for version control using Git, a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later.
* Commit is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like a 'save' for Git repositories.
* Branch is a separate version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It's used when working on a new feature or bug fix, so that changes can be done without affecting the main (master) repository.
* Example of creating a new branch:
```markdown
> Click "Branch: master", Type a branch name (e.g., "new-feature"), Hit "Enter".
```

### Collaboration 🤝
* GitHub allows multiple people to work on a project without affecting the main repository. Changes can be proposed (pull request), and those proposed changes can be reviewed, discussed, and eventually merged into the project.
* "Forks" are a way to copy a repository from one user's account to another, allowing modification without affecting the original project.
* "Pull requests" suggest changes to the repository. After making changes in a branch, a pull request helps notify others about the changes, sparking discussion and review.
* Example of creating a pull request:
```markdown
> Go to the new branch, click "New pull request", In the "Compare changes" page, ensure it's the changes to review, If everything is fine, click "Create pull request".
```

### Project Management 🗂️
* GitHub provides tools to track issues and add task lists within repositories.
* "GitHub Pages" is a static page generator with templates for easy webpage creation.
* Pull requests can be linked directly to issues, closing them when the pull request is merged.
* Built-in project boards and milestones help with project organization and planning.
* Example of creating an issue:
```markdown
> Go to the repository, click "Issues", click "New issue", type a title and description for the issue, click "Submit new issue".
```

### Miscellaneous Tips 🔮
* GitHub supports numerous markup languages (e.g., Markdown, ReStructuredText, AsciiDoc, and more).
* Emojis can be added to GitHub using the `:EMOJI:` syntax.
* Tags (@user or #issue) can be used to bring attention to a user or issue right within conversations or pull requests.
* Good practice: Use clear and meaningful commit messages, properly comment your code, and update READMEs regularly.

### Conclusion 🏁
GitHub is a robust platform that has its uses in various industries - Be it for individual or team projects, version control, or project management - Mastering GitHub will significantly enhance your productivity and collaboration capabilities.
