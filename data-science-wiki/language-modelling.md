Language modelling is a fascinating domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to construct models capable of predicting the next word in a sentence given the previous words. These models have applications in a wide range of areas such as *speech recognition*, *machine translation*, *part-of-speech-tagging*, and more.

In this document, we will delve into understanding language modelling, its types, and their benefits and drawbacks. Let's get started! 🚀

## 1. What is Language Modelling? 📚

Language Modelling aims to measure the probability of a sequence of words appearing in a sentence. In other words, it assigns probabilities to the combinations of words used in a language. For example, given the sentence "I am going to the ___", a language model predicts the word completing the sentence, say "market", based on the likelihood of the word appearing after the previous sequence.

## 2. Types of Language Models 👨‍🔬

Language models are primarily of three types:

- **Statistical Language Models**: Use traditional statistical techniques like N-Grams, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), etc. to predict probabilities of sentences and sequences of words.

- **Neural Language Models**: Use Deep Learning techniques for prediction. Notable models include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer-based models like BERT, GPT, etc.

- **Hybrid Language Models**: Combine the strengths of both statistical and neural models for effective prediction.

## 3. Applications of Language Modelling 💡

Language models have a wide range of applications such as:

- **Machine Translation**: Translating a sentence of one language to another.

- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into written form.

- **Information Retrieval**: Fetching relevant documents or information based on a user query.

- **Text Summarization**: Generating concise summaries of large documents or paragraphs.

- **Text Generation**: Producing new text data based on the trained language model.

## 4. Pros and Cons of Language Modelling ⚖️

### Pros 🌟

- Provides the context necessary for understanding languages.
- Powers several applications from keyword prediction to translation.
- Neural language models show high accuracy and effectiveness.

### Cons 🚧

- Statistical models often suffer from the problem of sparsity.
- Neural models can be computationally intensive and require huge amounts of data.
- It might generate sentences that are grammatically correct but semantically incorrect.
