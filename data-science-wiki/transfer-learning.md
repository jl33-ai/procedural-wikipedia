## :dart: Overview

Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. 

For instance, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.

## :footprints: Steps Involved

1. Choose source task.
2. Train a neural network on the source task.
3. Create a new neural network model. Take not to copy all except the output layer from the trained source network to the target one.
4. Train the new network on the target task.

```python
from keras.applications import Xception

# Load Xception model
base_model = Xception(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Freeze base model
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

...
```

## :label: Types of Transfer Learning

1. **Inductive Transfer Learning**: The target task is of the same type as the source task, but has different distribution instances.
2. **Transductive Transfer Learning**: Both source and target tasks are the same, but the instances of the target task are different.
3. **Unsupervised Transfer Learning**: Unlabelled target task instances are similar or related to the source task instances.

## :gift: Benefits of Transfer Learning

- :rocket: Improved learning efficiency.
- :moneybag: Reduced computational resources.
- :clock1: Minimized training time.
- :bar_chart: Enhanced performance of models.

## :no_entry: Limitations of Transfer Learning

- Can create negative transfer if the source and target tasks are not related.
- Not beneficial when source task dataset is small in volume.

<a name="conclusion"></a>

## :end: Conclusion

Transfer learning is a powerful ML technique that can improve training efficiency, reduce computation, save time, and enhance model performance. However, it should be used with caution to avoid negative transfer.
