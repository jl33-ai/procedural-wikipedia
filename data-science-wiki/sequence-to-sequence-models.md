## Introduction 🚀
Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are a type of models capable of converting one sequence into another. The sequences can have different lengths, proving helpful in various tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and voice recognition.

## Architecture 🏛
Seq2seq models typically consist of two components:
1. **Encoder**: The encoder processes the input sequence and condenses the information into a context vector, also known as the "thought vector", representing the source data.
2. **Decoder**: The decoder takes this context vector and generates the target sequence.

Both encoder and decoder are usually implemented using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

```markdown
➡️ [Input Sequence] --Encoder--> [Context Vector] --Decoder--> [Output Sequence]
```

## Usage 💼
Common use-cases of Seq2Seq models include:
- **Machine Translation**: Translating a sentence from one language to another.
- **Text Summarization**: Condensing a long document into a brief summary.
- **Speech to Text**: Converting spoken language into written text.
- **Chatbots**: Generating appropriate responses to user's queries.

## Advantages 🌟
- Seq2Seq models can handle sequences of **variable lengths**.
- These models capture the **context** of the input sequence better as the entire sequence is taken as input initially.
- They can generate output sequences that are of **different lengths** than input sequences.

## Example 📝

Let's take an example of a seq2seq model used in machine translation:

```markdown
Input:  ["je", "suis", "étudiant"]
Encoder:  ----> [Context Vector: {some representation}]
Decoder:  ----> ["I", "am", "a", "student"]
```

Here, the sequence `["je", "suis", "étudiant"]` (French for "I am a student") is input to the model. The encoder processes this input, generates a context vector. The decoder uses this context vector to generate the English translation `["I", "am", "a", "student"]`.
