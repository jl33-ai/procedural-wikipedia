# Image Classification with Machine Learning üñºÔ∏èü§ñ
#### Created by @jl33-ai üë¶üèª

Image Classification is a fundamental task that attempts to comprehend an entire image as a whole. The goal is to classify the image by assigning it to a specific label. Typically, image classification tasks are powered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a kind of machine learning model.

## Overview üòØ
Image classification is the process of predicting a specific class, or label, for something that is defined by a set of data points. Image classification models are trained on large datasets of images and then used to predict the class of new images.

Examples of use-cases can be:
- Identifying objects in images (i.e. "Is there a cat in this image?")
- Identifying facial features (i.e. "Where are the eyes in this picture?")
- Medical image analytics (i.e. "Is there a tumor shown in this MRI?")

## Prerequisites ‚úÖ
- Python Programming: Familiarity with Python and basic libraries such as Numpy and Matplotlib is needed.
- Basic Understanding of machine learning principles.

## Workflow Steps üöÄ

The basic image classification workflow steps are:

1. Import libraries: The first step in any project is to import the necessary libraries. For an image classification problem, you would usually import cv2, tensorflow, matplotlib, etc.

2. Load Data: The next step is to load the image data that you wish to classify.

3. Preprocess Data: Preprocess the image data. This might involve resizing, grayscale, normalizing etc.

4. Create Model: The next step is to create a model. This is typically done using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

5. Train Model: The next step is to train the model using your preprocessed data.

6. Evaluate Model: Evaluate the performance of your model by using a suitable metric (eg: accuracy).

7. Improve Model: If the accuracy is not satisfactory, adjust the parameters or architecture of the model.

8. Save and Use Model: Finally, if you are satisfied with the model's performance, save it for future use.

```Python
# Import required libraries
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Load data
data = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

# Preprocess data
processed_data = preprocess(data)

# Create model
model = create_model()

# Train model
model.fit(processed_data)

# Evaluate model
model.evaluate()

# Improve or save model
model.save('image_classifier.h5')
```

## Conclusion üí°
Image classification is a useful technique for a wide range of applications - from security and surveillance to social media and entertainment. With the power of libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, it is becoming easier to design powerful and efficient deep learning models.
