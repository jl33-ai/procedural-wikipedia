## Introduction üèÅ
This document aims to introduce some advanced techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. These are important areas in Machine Learning that deal with text and image data respectively.

## Techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP) üó£<a name="nlp"></a>

- **Word Embeddings**: A technique where words are converted into numerical vectors that represent their context in the text. Popular models for creating word embeddings include Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText.

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
sentences = [["cat", "say", "meow"], ["dog", "say", "woof"]]
model = Word2Vec(sentences, min_count=1)
```
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: This is an advanced neural network architecture that's designed to handle sequential data by having 'memory' of previous inputs in its hidden layers.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(SimpleRNN(100))
model.add(Dense(1))
```
- **Transformers**: These are models that use self-attention mechanisms, capable of modelling complex relationships in text. They're especially used in state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT.

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
```

## Techniques for Computer Vision üëÅ<a name="computer-vision"></a>

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: CNNs are especially suited for image processing due their structure of convolution and pooling layers.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```
- **Image Segmentation**: This technique outputs a pixel-wise mask of the object in image. Techniques like U-Net and Mask R-CNN are popular.

```python
# Using U-Net architecture in Keras
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, concatenate, Dropout, Conv2DTranspose

def create_unet():
    inputs = Input((img_rows, img_cols, 1))
    # ... create layers here ...
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output_layer)
    return model
```
- **Transfer Learning**: Re-use of pre-trained models on new data. Effective when data for the problem at hand is limited.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)
x = base_model.output
predictions = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
```

## Conclusion üèÅ<a name="conclusion"></a>

These were just a few of the many advanced techniques used in the fields of NLP and Computer Vision. It's important to continue exploring and staying up-to-date with the latest developments to keep improving your models!
