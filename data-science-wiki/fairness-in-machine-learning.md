# Fairness in Machine Learning
Created by @jl33-ai 👦🏻

Fairness in Machine Learning is a crucial aspect to consider when developing algorithms and models. It is about ensuring that the AI system does not favor one group over the other and that it is unbiased in its predictions or classifications.

## 📜 Introduction to Fairness in Machine Learning

Fairness in Machine Learning refers to how evenly the Machine Learning models deal with people irrespective of their race, gender, ethnicity, etc. The aim is to make the Machine Learning models:
- Unbiased
- Fair
- Transparent

## ⚖️ Bias in Machine Learning

Bias in Machine Learning can arise due to:
- Incomplete or unrepresentative data
- Prejudice in data collection
- Bias in algorithm designing

When the Machine Learning model offers a systematic error or favours certain groups, classes, or labels over others, it is referred to as bias. This could potentially make algorithms discriminatory, toxic, or harmful.

## 🛠️ Techniques to Achieve Fairness in Machine Learning

Achieving fairness in Machine Learning involves carefully designing algorithms and models while also paying attention to the data they are being trained on. Some of these techniques include:
- **De-biasing algorithms**: Modify existing algorithms to reduce bias.
- **Fair representation learning**: Learn a data representation which encodes the data well but obfuscates information about sensitive variables.
- **Balanced datasets**: Endeavour to collect balanced datasets that represent all classes, groups, or individuals evenly.

## 📏 Fairness Metrics in Machine Learning

Several fairness metrics can be used to measure the fairness of a model:

- **Demographic parity**: This checks whether the positive prediction rates are the same among different demographic groups.

- **Equal opportunity**: This checks whether true positive rates are the same among different groups.

# 🌐 Examples

Let's consider an example where an AI model is used for hiring purposes. 

- Without fairness: The model might unduly favor male candidates over females if it has been trained on data dominated by successful male employees.

- With fairness: The hiring model should treat candidates equally irrespective of their gender, promoting a balanced and inclusive recruitment process.

It's crucial to ensure and constantly monitor fairness in Machine Learning models to prevent unintentional harm or discrimination. 

By taking care of fairness in Machine Learning, we can build robust models that respect human values, promote inclusivity, and treat every individual with fairness.
