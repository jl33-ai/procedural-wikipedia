## Types of Observational Studies <a name='types-of-observational-studies'></a>

There are three key types of observational studies:
* Longitudinal Studies: This study takes place over a long duration of time.
* Cross-Sectional Studies: Quick and easy to conduct, this kind of study considers data at a specific point in time.
* Case-Control Studies: This type of study involves two groups of individuals— the subjects who have a specific condition and the subjects who do not. The researchers study the relationship between the condition and other variables.

## Steps Involved in Observational Studies <a name='steps-involved-in-observational-studies'></a>

1. **Define Objective 🎯:** The first step involves clearly defining the purpose of the study.

2. **Choose Study Type 📖:** The researchers decide the types of observational study testing which suits their research progression.

3. **Select Participants 👥:** The researchers decide on the demographic or group to participate in the study.

4. **Collect Data 📊:** The researchers gather data by observing participants, considering variables like behaviour, outcomes, and exposure to certain conditions.

5. **Analyze Data 💻:** Researchers use statistical methods to evaluate the relationships between different variables.

6. **Report Results 📝:** Finally, researchers will conclude their findings and publish them.

### Pros :
* Can be more ethical as it doesn't involve manipulating variables
* Provides access to data in natural settings
* Useful for generating hypotheses

### Cons :
* Can't establish cause-and-effect relationships
* Data may be prone to bias
* Difficult to control all variables
