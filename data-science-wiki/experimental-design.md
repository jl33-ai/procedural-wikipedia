## Introduction 🎴

Experimental design refers to how participants are allocated to the different conditions (or IV levels) in an experiment. Proper experimental design seeks to ensure that the results obtained are due to the independent variable and not some other extraneous factors.

## Types of Experimental Design
1. ***True Experimental Design***: This design is considered to be the most accurate form of experimental design as it randomly assigns subjects to different conditions.
2. ***Quasi Experimental Design***: This design maims for a carefully controlled set up but falls short because it does not randomly assign individuals to conditions.
3. ***Pre-experimental Design***: This is a single-group observed at a single time point or observed at multiple time points before and after an intervention without a control group.

## Principles of Experimental Design 🔍

The key principles of a good experimental design are as follows:

1. **Randomization**: This helps ensure that the experiment is not influenced by confounding variables.
2. **Replication**: Repeating the experiment helps ensure the validity and repeatability of the experiment.
3. **Blocking**: This involves organizing experimental units into blocks or groups to reduce the effects of variability.

## Randomized Control Trial 🔄

In medicine and statistics, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a type of scientific (often medical) experiment that aims to reduce certain sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of new treatments. This is done by randomly allocating subjects to two or more groups: treating a group (experimental group), control group (where no treatment is given) and others given a placebo.

##### Example 📖
A group of 100 cancer patients are randomly allocated to two groups: `Group A` receives a new drug while `Group B` gets the standard treatment. The cancer progression in both groups is measured over a period of 5 years.

## Quasi-Experimental Design 👥

A quasi-experimental design is similar to an experimental design but lacks the element of random assignment to treatment or control. Instead, subjects are assigned to conditions based on an attribute or characteristic. While the results are not as robust in showing causal relationships, they are often considered good enough to suggest them.

##### Example 📖
The effect of diet on health outcomes may use a quasi-experimental design where one group with a certain type of dietary habit (vegetarian) is compared to another group with a different dietary habit (non-vegetarian), and health outcomes are compared.

**Note:** These are just basic principles and types of experimental design. Each has their complexities and variances depending upon the research topic and context. Appropriate statistical techniques and knowledge of the underlying scientific principles are necessary to design a successful experiment.
