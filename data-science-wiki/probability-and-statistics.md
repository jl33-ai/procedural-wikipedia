## Introduction

In this document, we're going to cover the basics of probability and statistics. 

- Probability 🎲 is a branch of mathematics that describes the pattern of chance outcomes.
- Statistics 📊 is an area of applied mathematics concerned with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data.

## Probability

### Concept of Probability

The concept of probability is straightforward, it's a measure of the likelihood that a given event will occur.

#### Example 
Turn a <u>fair coin</u>, the probability of heads is 0.5.

### Types of Probability

There are three types of probability:

1. __Experimental (empirical) probability__ 🧪: It's based on the observations obtained from probability experiments.

2. __Theoretical probability__ 📖: It's based on the theoretical reasons. 

3. __Subjective probability__ 🧠: It involves personal judgment.

### Probability Rules

There are a few set rules that probabilities must follow:

1. The probability of an event can range from 0 to 1 (0 means the event will never occur, 1 means the event will definitely occur).

2. The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1.

3. The probability that an event does not occur is 1 minus the probability that it does occur.

## Statistics

Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.

### Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics describes or summarizes data in a meaningful way. It comprises two statistical methods:

1. __Measure of central tendency__ 📍: This involves mean, median and mode.

2. __Measure of dispersion__ 🔍: This involves variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, range and quartiles.

### Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics extends the findings derived from the descriptive statistics by drawing conclusions beyond the immediate data.

### Key Statistical Concepts

- __Correlation__: It’s a statistical measure that describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. 

- __Regression__: It’s a statistical method that helps in quantitative prediction of one variable from the other.

- __Sequence of random variables__: A sequence of random variables or stochastic process is a mathematical model for a sequence of outcomes satisfying certain conditions of randomness.

- __Hypothesis Testing__: It is an inferential statistical analysis that determines the probability of a certain hypothesis being true or not.
