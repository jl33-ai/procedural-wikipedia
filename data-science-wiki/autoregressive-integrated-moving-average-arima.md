> Created by @jl33-ai üë¶üèª  

An Autoregressive Intergraded Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a class of statistical models that are widely used for time-series forecasting. In this document, we will explore what makes ARIMA model unique and how it is used in time-series analysis.

## 1. Introduction to ARIMA üöÄ

- ARIMA, which stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, is a forecasting algorithm based on the idea that the information in the past values of the time series can be used to predict the future values.
- It is a generalization of the simpler AutoRegressive Moving Average and adds the notion of integration.
- An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p, d, q.

## 2. Components of ARIMA üìä

- **p** or Autoregressive part: The number of lag observations in the model. (AR)
- **d** or Integrated part: The number of times that raw observations are differenced for stationarity. (I)
- **q** or Moving average part: The size of moving average window. (MA)

These three parameters are called the order of the ARIMA model.

## 3. Applications of ARIMA üíª

ARIMA models are used for :

- Stock price forecasting
- Forecasting the number of viewers of a show
- Predicting the number of passengers in airlines
- And many other time series related forecasting.

## 4. ARIMA in Python üêç
Here's how you can use the ARIMA model in Python:

```python
# Importing the necessary libraries
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA
import pandas as pd

# Loading the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Fitting the model
model = ARIMA(data, order=(1,1,1))
model_fit = model.fit(disp=0)

# Making predictions
forecast = model_fit.predict(start=2, end=10, typ = 'levels')

print(forecast)
```

Note: Modify the order=(1,1,1) based on your dataset and requirements.

And that's all about applying ARIMA to time-series forecasting! Let's keep exploring.
