## Data Encryption 🔒

GitHub uses industry-standard encryption to protect your data.

 - **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: For data in transit, GitHub uses TLS to provide a secure connection.
    ```python
    https://github.com
    ```
 - **At-rest Encryption**: For data at rest, GitHub uses AES-256 encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available.
    ```python
    encrypt_function(your_data, AES-256)
    ```

## Security Features 👮

Github offers several features to keep your repositories secure:

 - **Two-factor Authentication**: Enhances security by requiring two types of identification before you can access your account.
  ```
  Your Password + Verification Code on your mobile
  ```

 - **Security Alerts**: Notifies you when dependencies in your repository have known vulnerabilities.
    ```python
    <img src='security alert screenshot'>
    ```

 - **Dependabot**: Automatically creates pull requests to update your dependencies.

## Privacy Policy 📄

Your privacy is important to GitHub. GitHub's privacy policy dictates:

 - Your personal information is kept confidential and stored securely.
 - Your data will not be shared, sold, or rented to third parties for marketing purposes without your consent.
 - You have the right to access, rectify or erase your personal data.

## User Responsibility 🙋‍♂️

While GitHub provides the tools, it's also crucial for users to be aware of their roles in data security.

 - Be mindful of the data you are uploading.
 - Regularly update your password and consider using a password manager.
 - Use two-factor authentication whenever possible.
