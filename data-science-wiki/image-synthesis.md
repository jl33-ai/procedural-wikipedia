Image synthesis is a fascinating area which lies at the intersection of computer vision and artificial intelligence. It involves the creation of an image from a description or manipulations and combinations of existing images. This notebook will take you through the basics of image synthesis using Python.

## About Image Synthesis
Image Synthesis refers to the process of creating new images. They can either be completely new images created from scratch or transformed versions of existing ones.

## Image Synthesis Techniques ⚙️

Different techniques for image synthesis:
1. **Texture Synthesis** – generation of a large digital image from a small digital image.
2. **Image Analogies** – process to create an image 'B' out of an image 'A', such that the relation between 'A' and 'B' is similar to the relation between two provided images.
3. **Deep learning-based methods, particularly GANs** – technique consists of two parts, a generator, and a discriminator.

## Python Libraries for Image Synthesis 📚

Below are some Python libraries that will assist in image synthesis projects:
- OpenCV : For image processing tasks.
- Pillow : For manipulating images.
- Dlib : For applying deep learning.
- TensorFlow/Keras : To design, train and utilize neural network models.
- PyTorch : An alternative to TensorFlow/Keras.

## Code Snippets 💻

Here's a simple example of image synthesis - creating an image of a rectangle using OpenCV.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Create an image with black background
image = np.zeros((300,300,3), dtype = "uint8")

# Draw a rectangle
cv2.rectangle(image, (50,50), (250,250), (255,255,255), -1)

# Save the image
cv2.imwrite("rectangle.png", image)
```
