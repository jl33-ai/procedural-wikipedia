# Control Structures in Programming 🕹️
#### Created by @jl33-ai 👦🏻

A control structure is a block of programming that directs the flow of control through the algorithm. They are used to make decisions, repeat operations and handle disturbances.

In this document, we'll cover the three basic types of control structures which are:

1. Sequential control structure 
2. Selection control structure
3. Loop control structure

## Sequential Control Structure 👣

Sequential or linear control structures refer to a series of statements executed in the order that they are arranged in the program. 

Example:
```python
print("Hello!")
print("My name is jl33-ai.")
print("It's nice to meet you.")
```

## Selection Control Structure 👀

This control structure involves decision making. It's typically implemented with `if`,  `if...else`, `if...elif...else`, and `switch` statements. 

Example:
```python
is_raining = False
if is_raining:
    print("Take an umbrella!")
else:
    print("Enjoy the sunshine!")
```

## Loop Control Structure ➰

Loop control structures are used for executing the same lines of code multiple times until a specific condition is met.

Commonly used loop structures are `while`, `do...while`, and `for` loops.

Example:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print("I'm looping! This is loop number", i)
```

## Tag Summary 📌

Here is a summary of the main tags used in control structures:

- `if`: used to test a specific condition.
- `else`: provides alternate commands when the `if` statement's conditions aren't met.
- `elif`: allows for multiple, specific conditions to be tested.
- `for`: initiates a loop that continues for a certain number of iterations.
- `while`: starts a loop that continues as long as a specific condition is true.

## Conclusion 🏁

By understanding control structures, you can write more efficient and flexible code. Mastering these is a fundamental step towards becoming a proficient programmer. Happy coding!
