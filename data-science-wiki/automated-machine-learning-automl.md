## Introduction üöÄ

Automated Machine Learning or AutoML is the process of automating the process of applying Machine Learning (ML) to real-world problems. AutoML covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable ML models.

## Benefits of AutoML üí™

- **Efficiency**: AutoML can automatically complete data preprocessing, feature selection, feature engineering, model selection and hyperparameter tuning tasks.
- **Accessibility**: It democratizes the ML model development process, allowing non-experts to make use of machine learning models and techniques.
- **Robustness**: Identifies the best models which are data-driven, reducing the chances of overfitting and underfitting.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures that machine learning models follow the best practices, providing clear lineage for actions taken.

## How Does AutoML Work? üßê

AutoML typically involves the following steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: AutoML systems clean data and handle missing values, categorical variables, and high cardinality variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: The system automatically generates new features to improve the model performance.
- **Model Selection**: AutoML chooses the right machine learning model from a wide range of algorithm families.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: It optimizes multiple parameters in order to improve model prediction capabilities.

```python
from automl import AutoML

# Load dataset
dataset = AutoML.load_dataset("my_dataset.csv")

# Define target variable
target = "target_column"

# Initialize the AutoML model
automl = AutoML(target)

# Train the AutoML model
automl.train(dataset)
```

## AutoML Frameworks üß∞

Several AutoML frameworks are available:

1. **Auto-sklearn**: Open-source AutoML tool that uses sklearn ML models.
2. **H2O.ai**: Provides an open-source machine learning platform that supports both statistical & machine learning algorithms along with deep learning.
3. **Google AutoML**: Provides the power and capability to build ML models with minimal programming experience.

## Limitations of AutoML ‚ö†Ô∏è

Despite the numerous benefits, there are a couple of limitations:

- It can be challenging to interpret models and predictions. Even for experts in the field, it can take time to understand how decisions are being made.
- It may not handle domain-specific applications or datasets well without customization.
- Depending on the amount of data and complexity, they can consume a lot of computational resources.
