Style Transfer is a fun and fascinating part of Machine Learning. It involves extracting aesthetic styles from one image and meshing them with the content of another image. This markdown is guide to help you understand the fundamentals of Style Transfer right from the basics to the depths 🔍.

## Brief Introduction 📝 <a name="brief-introduction"></a>

Style Transfer is a technique in Deep Learning that leverages the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from images. It was made famous by [Gatys et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) in their paper, "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style."

## Step-by-Step Overview 👣 <a name="step-by-step-overview"></a>

1. **Content Image & Style Image**: The process begins by choosing a source image (content image) and a style image.

2. **Preprocessing**: The images are then preprocessed, usually by resizing them to have the same dimensions.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Features from the content and style images are then extracted with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network model, typically [VGG19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556).

4. **Content Loss & Style Loss Calculation**: Based on these features, two losses are calculated; the content loss compares the content pixels of the generated image to the content pixels of the source image, while the style loss does the same but for style.

5. **Backpropagation & Optimization**: The total loss (content loss + style loss) is minimized using Backpropagation and an Optimization algorithm.

6. **Reconstruction**: The minimized loss functional is then used to reconstruct/generated the final stylized image.
