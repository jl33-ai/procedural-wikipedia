# Bias Detection and Mitigation 🧐 
### Created by @jl33-ai 👦🏻

Bias can sneak into your ML models and skew the results, causing the decisions based on those predictions to be unfair or prejudiced. 🧐 This notebook guides you on how to detect and mitigate bias.

## What is Bias? 🤔 
Bias refers to an error that systematically skews results or predictions from the truth. In the context of ML, a biased model could result in unfair treatment or disadvantage towards certain groups. 

## Types of Bias 🧩
There are several types of bias that could exist in an ML model:
1. **Sampling bias**: Occurs when the data collected is not representative of the entire population.
2. **Confirmation bias**: Tendency to prefer data that supports our existing beliefs and reject data that contradicts them.
3. **Measurement bias**: Introduced due to faulty data collection methods.
4. **Algorithmic bias**: Arises due to the inherent limitations or assumptions made by the selected algorithm.

```python
# Example of sampling bias
# If we only use images of cats to train an image classification model, it'll predict every image as a cat!
```

## Bias Detection 🕵️
Detecting bias in a ML model is crucial to ensure fair outcomes. Key methods includes:

1. **Data audit**: Investigate the training data and see if certain groups are over/under-represented.
2. **Model evaluation**: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall to inspect model performance across different groups.
3. **Residual analysis**: Inspect the prediction errors - are they higher for certain groups?

```python
# Example of model evaluation
# Compare accuracy of the model on different groups - men vs women, different age-groups, etc.
```

## Bias Mitigation 💪
Ways to address bias include:

1. **Collect more data**: Broaden your data collection to encompass a wider representation of the population.
2. **Stratified sampling**: When partitioning data, ensure each group is adequately represented.
3. **Algorithm modification**: Choose or modify algorithms to reduce their inherent bias.
4. **Post-hoc method**: Adjust the model's final predictions to make them fairer.

```python
# Example of stratified sampling
# Ensure your training and test data has equal proportions of different classes
```

## Conclusion 🎯
Bias in ML models can lead to unfair and prejudicial outcomes. It's essential to detect and mitigate bias effectively for the model to function properly. Only then can we ensure ethical and fair ML practices.
