## What are GDPR and CCPA?🧐
- GDPR stands for _General Data Protection Regulation_, implemented by the European Union 🇪🇺 in 2018, is a regulation for data protection and privacy for all individual citizens
- CCPA or the _California Consumer Privacy Act_ was adopted by the state of California in 2018. Similar to GDPR, it grants rights to consumers regarding their personal data

## Comparison Between GDPR and CCPA🚁
While these two dealings with data privacy, they approach it in slightly different ways:

- **Scope:** GDPR applies to all organizations operating within the EU, also to the non-EU based businesses if they offer goods or services to the EU residents. CCPA applies to businesses that collect personal data of California residents and meet at least one of three specific criteria 🎯
- **User Rights:** Under GDPR, users have the right to access, correct, delete their personal data and restrict or oppose processing. In comparison, CCPA allows users to know, access, and delete their data. It also gives users the right to opt-out of data sales ⛔️

## Implications and Compliance 😇
- **Penalties:** Both GDPR and CCPA impose penalties for non-compliance. GDPR penalties can be up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 Million (whichever is greater), while CCPA fines can reach up to $7,500 for each intentional violation and $2,500 for each unintentional violation 🚫
- **Compliance:** Businesses should ensure that they are equipped with the right tools and practices to avoid these monetary penalties. They also should focus on training employees, updating safety measures, performing audits and other steps to maintain compliance ✅
