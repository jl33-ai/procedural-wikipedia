## Introduction 🎯

The K-Means algorithm is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm utilized predominantly for grouping a dataset into 'k' clusters. It is also known as the centroid-based clustering technique.

<a id='how-it-works'></a>
## How It Works 🔧

A centroid is the geometric center of a cluster. Initially, we randomly assign 'k' centroids. Each data point from the dataset is then assigned to its nearest centroid, forming 'k' clusters. Later on, the position of each centroid is updated based on the positions of the members(data points) of its cluster, which ultimately may result in data points being assigned to new clusters. This procedure is repeated until none of the centroids’ positions change.

## Steps Involved 🚶🏾

Follow these steps to perform K-means clustering:

1. **Initialization**: Randomly initialize 'k' centroids.
2. **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming 'k' clusters.
3. **Update Step**: Update the position of each centroid to the mean of data points in its cluster.
4. **Convergence**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids have stabilized (no data point changes its cluster).

## Advantages & Disadvantages 📊

### Advantages 💡

- Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
- Efficiency: Fast and efficient in terms of computational cost.
- Scalability: Works well with large datasets.

### Disadvantages 🚫

- Requires prior knowledge of 'k' (number of clusters).
- Sensitivity to initialization: Different initializations of centroids may produce different results.
- Not suitable for non-spherical clusters or clusters of different sizes and densities.

## Conclusion 🏁

The K-Means algorithm is a powerful clustering tool in machine learning. It's a quick and easy-to-understand algorithm that can be handy in many real-world machine learning applications. However, it’s important to consider its limitations and suitability for your particular dataset.

This guide gives you a foundational understanding of the K-Means algorithm. For a more detailed understanding, consider diving deeper into the math behind it and experimenting with its implementation in various programming languages.
